# fpFIF2
2D fringe pattern Fast Iterative FIltering (fpFIF2) is an algorithm that decomposes the given image into several instrinct mode functions (IMFs) and each IMF consists a different frequency component of the image. fpFIF2 is dedicated to work with optical fringe pattern images, in particular to separate their: noise, fringes and background components. <br>
This code was based on the 2D Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF2) algorithm: https://github.com/Acicone/FIF2
